Next Steps:

1. Use playerprefs to store the best score on each level.
2. Make the Castle parts out of various materials, some of which have more/less materials, add breaking
3. Show lines for multiple previous paths rather than just the most recent one.
4. Use a Line Renderer to draw the rubber band of the slingshot.
5. Implement actual parallax scrolling on the background clouds, and add more background elements
   like mountains or buildings.
